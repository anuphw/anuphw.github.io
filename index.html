                    <p>Organizational are thought to evolve to have different routines and skill sets, which in turn explain both
                        behavioral differences and outcome differences. One fundamental difference is in how decisions are
                        made, as organizations may differ both in criteria and approaches, but such differences are difficult to
                        assess directly because researchers rarely have access to sufficiently many decisions made within and
                        across organizations. Using newly available data, we examine strategic time wasting in professional
                        football (soccer), comparing decision-making routines reflecting rational behavior, anchoring and
                        adjustment, and contextual heuristics. We find the most common overall decision-making approach for
                        systematic and strategic time wasting, and but also find that organizations have distinct differences in
                        their decision making. We proceed to drill down to the levels of the team, the manager, and the individual
                        players as sources of these differences. Our findings demonstrate a general approach for analyzing
                        sources of decision-making differences, and show that in this context, players and coaches are the most 
                        important sources of organizational decision-making routines, with teams having a weaker effect.</p>

                <p>When organizational tasks require rapid and accurate decision making in order to avoid costly
                    failure, it is of interest to examine the quality of decisions in general, and specifically the
                    conditions under which it deteriorates. We take some propositions on individual decision making
                    that have been explored most extensively in experimental studies and investigate them in a high-stakes
                    field context involving teamwork: football (soccer) in a European top division. We
                    examine fouls – behaviors that help the team but are against the rules – and start by checking the
                    fit of a model of rational fouling. Next we examine deviations from this model, and are
                    particularly interested in the effects on decision-making of stress and anger from personal failure.
                    We show that fouls (destructive play) are made rationally overall, and with reductions in
                    rationality that follow the predictions of theory on loss aversion and stress.</p>

            <p>Referee is one of the most important element in Football who influences the outcome of a game.
                Although Football has well defined rules, they are not complete. A big portion of decision is still left to referees judgement.
                In this research, we focus on two of such rules: Offside and Foul. 
                We collected videos of close call instances (both called and not called) for offsides and fouls. 
                We asked top referees from Europe to code whether the instance we foul/offside or not to get an unbiased decision.
                We study the impact of referee biases on mistakes that referees make namely, action mistake (calling a foul/offside in ambiguous situation) and inaction mistake (not calling in ambiguous situation).</p>

                <p>Conversion is one the most important KPI that is used to evaluate retail stores. 
                    It influences various decisions like staffing, advertisement expenditure, manager bonuses, etc.
                    We collected detailed behavioral data on customers visiting to multiple retail stores in Europe and Middle-east.
                    The data suggested that, group of customers seldom have multiple transactions and 
                    hance the traditional definition of conversion, which is the ratio of #Transactions to #Visitors, underestimates the actual conversion.
                    Moreover, the quality of traditional conversion estimate depends on the mean size of groups visiting the store.
                    In this paper, we mathematically modeled the customer arrival process and came up with five estimation techniques to structurally estimate the #Groups in given stream of customers using only traffic counter data. </p></div>

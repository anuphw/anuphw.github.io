<h1>Some definitions</h1>
<p>Whenever Arsenal looses ball possession in-play, I record speed and acceleration of each player towards their own goal line (X-direction) two seconds after loosing the ball possession.</p>

<p>I have 5 types of plots for both Speed and Acceleration of players, 2 seconds after loosing the ball. The types are as follow:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="Behind_ball_-_Speed.html">Speed</a> <a href="Behind_ball_-_Acceleration.html">Acceleration</a> When ball is lost, player is between ball and own goal.</li>
<li><a href="Ahead_of_ball_-_Speed.html">Speed</a> <a href="Ahead_of_ball_-_Acceleration.html">Acceleration</a> When ball is lost, player is between ball and opposition goal.</li>
<li><a href="Own_Half_-_Speed.html">Speed</a> <a href="Own_Half_-_Acceleration.html">Acceleration</a> When ball is lost, player is in own half.</li>
<li><a href="Other_Half_-_Speed.html">Speed</a> <a href="Other_Half_-_Acceleration.html">Acceleration</a> When ball is lost, player is in opposition half.</li>
<li><a href="Overall_-_Speed.html">Speed</a> <a href="Overall_-_Acceleration.html">Acceleration</a> All observations.</li>
</ol>
